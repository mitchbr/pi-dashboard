# Mitchell's Raspberry pi hub

Welcome to my raspberry pi hub! Here, I have everything I am currently hosting on a raspberry pi 5 in my home office. Some goals I have in hosting on a raspberry pi include:

- Self hosting so that I don't need to rely on free tiers with cloud hosting providers
- Learning about more of the infrastructure side of backend development, including standing up docker containers from scratch, developing my own CI/CD pipelines, or standing up databases from scratch and managing them in a linux "server" environment
- Learning more about React and other fullstack skills
